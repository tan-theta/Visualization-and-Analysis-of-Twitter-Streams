# Visualization and Analysis of Twitter Stream

Analyzing social media streams has gained importance in recent days. Visualizing the social media streams can aid in discovering new insights from the data and open up new opportunities for the government and businesses alike. In this project we have used twitter data from USA and SPAIN to show how social media streams can be explored from different perspectives.

## Datasets

* [USA](http://www.followthehashtag.com/datasets/free-twitter-dataset-usa-200000-free-usa-tweets/)

* [Spain](http://www.followthehashtag.com/datasets/spain_portugal/)

## To run the visualization system

* Clone this code to your local machine.
* Start a local server and open the **index.html** page.

### To start a local server (recommended python HTTP server, hence python must be installed)
* Open terminal and navigate to the cloned directory.
* Type in the following commands.
* `python2` python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000   `python3` python -m http.server 8000
*  Open browser and type in localhost:8000
